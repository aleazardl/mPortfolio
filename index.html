			<p class="lead">
			The world is changing and it’s changing fast with the help of technological innovations. Every day technology changes and there’s always something new that comes up. As an I.T. student, even I myself gets overwhelmed by all the new technological innovations that arises day after another.  It inspires me every time because I know technology won’t stop evolving soon which means there’s a lot more to learn and innovate, something that will help our society to move one step forward towards a much advanced future.
			<br>
			<br>
			After finishing my On the Job Training(OJT). I was able to learn new things in a working environment which focuses on IT. And I was also able to refresh my knowledge and apply what I’ve learned in my previous years of studying I.T. Understanding things I didn’t know was easier with the help of my heads and co-workers. I did not only learn but I also enjoyed my experience of working with them.

			<p class="lead">
			founded in 1990 as Southville International School (SIS) in a simple single-storey building (Elizalde Campus) meeting the basic requirements of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS). With two students and five teachers, SISC was initially recognized as a “Special School for the Intellectually Gifted.”SISC graduates have an excellent track record in gaining acceptance into top local and foreign universities. This long-standing tradition was started by the first two enrollees who studied Kinder up to High School at SISC. Both students eventually graduated with honors from top world-ranked universities in England.Grounded by its commitment to global excellence, Southville International School and Colleges (SISC) has no centuries of existence to take pride in as yet but its remarkable achievements speak of how it is now and in the years to come. SISC’s strength largely lies in academics most notably in the excellent passing rate of its courses with licensure exams, community service, innovative programs, and internationally-benchmarked curricula that have proven responsive to the needs of the students, the community, and the industry.</p>

Sir Sam also taught me a few things about answering phone calls and talking to students or teachers with concerns.
			</p>

			<h2 class="s-title">Tasks and Assignment</h2>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">At first i thought the tasks that they will ask me to do would actually be programming and debugging some programs. I was just partially right so I wasn’t really able to do any programming. one of my heads asked me if I wanted to and If I can, I told them I do but sadly there wasn’t any system or program to work with so I wasn’t able to practice my skills on that particular area.  I worked with software and hardware but most of the tasks I worked on is software related. I installed and uninstalled quite a few applications on different computers, cleaned up some disk space, checked system units and monitors specifications for the OCS in almost all computers in Luxembourg campus. On hardware related, I checked the computer, speakers, mouse, keyboard and almost all classrooms in basic education and see if everything is working fine. I also helped install access points in tropical for ISAC in tropical campus. 
	Some of these tasks were really challenging but is also fun to do at the same time. There were some that really annoyed me and drained me but it’s all just practice to what I’ll face soon and then I’ll be thankful that i still did it.

			<h2 class="s-title">Problems Encountered while Performing the Task</h2>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">I honestly had a lot of problems in any task that I had to perform in my early days at work and it’s because I always have problem adjusting to new environments and I actually had forgotten some of what I’ve learned from the past which affected my performance while doing or fixing something. In result, I had to keep asking questions, there even were times that I just searched for solutions on the internet because I was too shy to ask basic solutions to problems that I should already know. Some examples of what I’ve forgotten involves System unit parts and how to assemble it, Minor details about Network Management like what does an access point do, connecting a printer to another computer using the network or an IP address, etc. Some other problems that I’ve encountered is dealing with dusty areas and crouching while trying to fit myself when I had to go under the computer tables and connect unplugged USB, audio jack and most usually Ethernet. At the end of the day although I haven’t overcome all of this problems which resulted to me not fixing the problem, I still have tried and learned. And the amount of those I’ve accomplished still dominates that what I have not.

			I helped as a technical support at SISC Pageant with the lighting and music. We assisted with any help we could give. I even went home past working hours. I stayed until the pageant was done. We did the same in SGEN Pageant where we went home a bit later than we did in SISC Pageant. We did the same as what we did in SISC Pageant, We attended the practice and then go on with what was ask of us to do.
			</p>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">
			We installed new computers in the library and installed Cybera and other applications, did clean ups and checked if everything’s working. This took us almost a whole day to accomplish after having a lot of software and hardware problems on some computers.

			<h2 class="s-title">Overall Observation</h2>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">
                In my 2 and a half month of stay in the Management Information Systems department I have observed that with the help of my heads and co-practicums I have improved my skills particularly in communication and finding solutions to certain problems, things that I did not learn on my subjects. I was able to use some of my knowledge in IT, those that I’ve learned in my studies. I’ve observed that work environments can be different at times especially when something serious has happened and something important is due and needs to be done. Also when someone that is in high position is around everyone starts to act professional which for me is very normal and funny at the same time. Overall I’ve observed that there is always something new to learn in a work environment and that you shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions especially when you’re about to do something you don’t fully understand.
